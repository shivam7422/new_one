India’s football team captain Sunil Chhetri recently took to Twitter pleading fans to support his team in a four-nation tournament held in Mumbai. Virat Kohli, the captain of national
cricket team, doesn’t have to issue such appeals as he mostly plays in front of a full house. But football is gaining a following in India, more so after the launch of the professional 
Indian Super League. Over the next month, cricket will take a backseat as India joins the world in watching the FIFA World Cup.
