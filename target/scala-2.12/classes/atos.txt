Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine could be back in circulation this weekend—albeit with possible restrictions—depending on a recommendation Friday by a federal advisory panel. J&J vaccine injections were put on hold last week after reports of rare blood-clot conditions in a handful of recipients, including one fatality. Many public-health authorities, however, contend that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, has predicted the U.S. pause would end as soon as Friday, perhaps with new restrictions or warnings.
